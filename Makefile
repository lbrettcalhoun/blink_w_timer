# And these are the flags passed to the compiler ... they include the location of include files (.) and the

# from their respective locations in the SDK into my custom include directory

# And these are all the options passed to the linker ... mainly which libraries to link (main, net80211, etc).
# All these libraries live in $HOME/esp-open-sdk/sdk/lib and are prefixed with "lib".  Also note that 
# these libraries are nothing more than object files (.o) compressed into an ar archive.

# So here is how this works ... when you execute "make" it compiles and assembles (BUT IT DOESN'T LINK) the 
# user_main.c file.  Then the linker links the file together with all the libraries to
# form our executable.  Finally, it uses esptool.py to transform the executable into our 2 binaries which
# make up the firmware.  These actions happen automatically with just "make" based on the chaining.

# This one doesn't get called automatically.  Use "make flash" to actually flash the firmware to the ESP8266
# user_main-0x00000.bin is the boot firmare it is loaded to flash address 0x00000
# user_main-0x10000.bin is our custom firmware it is loaded to flash address 0x10000
